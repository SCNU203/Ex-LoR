(4) The clothing section and the automobile section are located in the north. (2) The automobile area is in the north V the daily necessities area is in the north → the intelligent equipment area is not in the east and the intelligent equipment area is not in the south. Therefore, the intelligent equipment area is not in the east and the intelligent equipment area is not in the south. And only two areas are set up in each location. The north is already full, the old intelligence equipment area is in the west, and the multi-functional medical area is not in the north. Therefore, (3) we can see that the multi-functional medical area is in the east. It can be seen from (5) that the food area and the household area are not in the same direction. Therefore, it can be seen from (1) that the household area and the daily necessities area are in the same direction. Since the west, north and east have been arranged, the home area and daily use area can only be in the south.

Second, look for arguments and arguments. Argument: The inclusion of a large number of atoms in a molecule is essential for a substance to have excellent thermal conductivity. The argument can be translated as: “Strong thermal conductivity → large number of atoms within a molecule“. According to Robinson's law, “A→B“ is the same as “¬A or B“, so the argument here is equivalent to either not conducting heat very well or containing a large number of atoms.

The substance made up of this molecule has a strong thermal conductivity in the same type of substance. (A) Add to the argument. A. A large number of atoms have strong thermal conductivity, and the argument is “or relation“, which means “one truth is true“. B) Add to the argument. B) It is not very conductive and contains a large number of atoms. The argument is “or relation“, which is true. C) Weakening the argument. Strong thermal conductivity and no Y structure, contradiction of argument: strong thermal conductivity and a molecule containing a large number of atoms, is the biggest weakening of the argument, but there is no such option, according to: Y structure → a large number of atoms are connected in series. Without a large number of atoms, there is no Y structure. Therefore, a strong thermal conductivity and a molecule without Y structure is also a contradiction of the argument, which has a weakening effect. D: Add to the argument.

A) All the major hospitals put their efforts into the project. B) All the hospitals put their efforts into it. B) Public hospitals, the relationship between them and R hospital is unknown. C indicates that not all hospitals participated in the survey, so the ranking of R hospital can not represent all hospitals, so the argument is weak. D) The ranking of hospitals with comparable medical quality is lower than that of hospitals R. Therefore, the quality of referral services may be the reason for the top ranking, which strengthens the argument",

Therefore, the occurrence of blood cancer in rats induced by experimental radiation can be controlled by limiting the food intake of the rats.",

The results found that those in senior management positions were generally fatter than the average worker. The researchers believe that the stress of making many decisions is relieved by the way you eat, which ultimately changes the way executives eat. If you're lucky enough to get promoted, you may find that not only is your salary expanding, but your waistline is expanding, along with your weight.",

    "explanation": "First step, determine the question type. According to the “question“ in the way of questioning, it is determined to weaken the argument. Second, look for arguments and evidence. Thesis: People in senior positions of power tend to be fatter than the average worker. The argument: The stress of making many decisions is relieved by the way they eat, which ultimately changes their eating habits to some extent. Step three: Identify the options. A: Irrelevant. The waistlines of “skilled people“ are compared with those of “decision-makers“. The waistlines of “senior executives in important positions“ and those of “general employees“ are compared with those of “decision-makers“. B) A negative argument. It suggests that the reason why senior executives in important positions are fatter is that it is harder to find time to exercise, not that changes in eating habits have had a debilitating effect. C) Add weight to the argument. In this article, the “skills-judging group“ is taken as an example. The waist size of the “skills-judging group“ will be smaller when you are promoted to a job level. However, the skills-judging group is not the group who need to make “decisions“. D) Add to the argument. D) People who move up a job class have a larger waistline, which is associated with a strengthening effect",
