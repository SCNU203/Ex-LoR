Researchers followed more than 1,000 people aged 46 to 55 for 12 years and found that 11 of those in the highest quarter of lycopene levels had a stroke, while 25 of those in the lowest quarter had a stroke.

    "explanation": "Unlawful cohabitation with the separated person includes two types: cohabitation between the separated person and the separated person; The separated person cohabitates with a non-married person (unmarried, divorced or widowed). ① From the question stem, it can be seen that illegal cohabitation refers to cohabitation between the opposite sex, so the separated people who live illegally with the separated person are equally divided between men and women. So check item III is false. (2) There are 1 million more women than men living illegally with separated persons, which means that there are more men than women living illegally with unmarried, divorced or widowed persons. So check item I is true. ③ A person who is living illegally with a separated person includes two parts, one is separated and the other is unmarried, divorced or widowed. Two conclusions have been drawn from the above: first, separated persons illegally cohabitating with separated persons are equally divided between men and women; Second, there are more men than women among unmarried, divorced or widowed people living illegally with a separated person.

But in fact, bees don't have to go to such lengths to communicate this information. The scent trail they leave behind as they fly back to the hive from the powder picking site is enough to lead their mates to the spot where the powder was picked. I don't entirely agree with you. Many animals can do a certain task in more than one way. For example, some bees can Orient themselves based on the position of the sun, or they can Orient themselves based on geographical features.

    "D": "pointed out that Professor Zhang had replaced the spotted owl with an endangered owl.",
    "answer": "C",
    "explanation": "Professor Zhang believes that the reason for the precipitous decline in the number of spotted owls is that timber logging companies are cutting down old forest areas in large quantities; Li attributes the decline to competition between the more fertile striped owls and the spotted owls for survival resources.

Argument: ① For the same person, the faster the heart rate, the more blood enters the circulation per unit time, and the red blood cells in the blood transport oxygen. The more oxygen a person obtains through the blood circulation per unit time, the better his physical fitness and play. ② At high altitudes, the number of red blood cells per unit volume of blood in the human body is higher than at low altitudes. The heart rate in the high-altitude area is not lower than that in the low-altitude area, so that in the case of the high-altitude area containing more red blood cells, improve the competitive level and have a strengthening effect. Using negative substitution, if the athlete's heart rate at high altitude is lower than that at low altitude, then although the number of red blood cells in the blood will increase at high altitude, the heart rate will slow down, which will lead to the inability to obtain more oxygen through more blood circulation, which will have a negative effect on physical performance, and there is no need to train at high altitude, which negates the argument.

The incidence of cancer and heart disease was 0.3 percent and 0.5 percent in the first group, 0.7 percent and 0.9 percent in the second group, and 2 percent and 7 percent in the third group, respectively. From this, some experts have come to the conclusion that donating blood is beneficial to reducing the risk of cancer and heart disease.

    "explanation": "If the check item I is true, the conclusion in the explanation will be weakened, because in general, the older people are, the more likely they are to suffer from cancer and heart disease, and the more elderly people there are, the higher the incidence of these two diseases will be. Otherwise the reverse is true. The question stem points out that the incidence of the first group is lower than that of the second group, which in turn is lower than that of the third group; But check I also pointed out that the proportion of people over 60 in the first group was lower than in the second group, which in turn was lower than in the third group. Therefore, it is very likely that the phenomenon described in the question stem is not caused by the number or presence of blood donations, but by differences in age or distribution. Check item II shows that the blood donor has a better physique before blood donation, so the good physique is not caused by blood donation, it has been formed as early as before blood donation. Therefore, compared with the first and second groups and the third group, the first two groups of objects have blood donation records, at least that they have a good physique before the first blood donation, and the third group of objects has never donated blood, their physique is not known, some of them are difficult to be screened through the way of pre-blood donation physical examination, Therefore, the incidence of cancer and heart disease in the third group is higher than that in the first two groups, which is very natural, and is not caused by blood donation. From this point of view, check II weakens the conclusion in the question. Check Ⅲ indicates the number of objects, which is irrelevant to the stem's conclusion.

    "explanation": "Look at the problem, if D's explanation is true, that is, one of the three people A, B, and C is telling the truth, and his car is red. At this time, the special element that affects the truth and false is the “red car“, so we can give priority to hypothesize from this special element. If B's car is red, then B's statement that C's car is red is true, then both B and C's cars are red, which contradicts the question, so B's car is not red. B's car is not red, B said is a lie, that is, C's car is not red, therefore C said is a lie, that is, D's car is blue. Since one of the three people in A, B and C has a red car, it can only be A's car that is red. Therefore, A told the truth, we can know that B's car is not white, and further we can know that B's car is silver. Combined with the residual method, we can know that C's car is white",

If these people deduced that their own dog was a sick dog, they had to shoot their own dog. But no one was allowed to tell anyone if he saw another's dog was a sick dog, and he had no right to shoot another's dog, only the right to shoot his own dog.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Because the village chief says there are sick dogs in the village, there should be at least one sick dog in the village. We can make the following hypothesis: If there is only one sick dog, the owner of the sick dog will find that other dogs are normal, and then deduce that his dog is the sick dog, and he will kill his dog on the first day. On the other hand, it means that everyone can see other people's sick dogs, and there is more than one sick dog in the village. The absence of gunfire on the first day means there was more than one sick dog in the village. If there are two sick dogs in the village, the owner of the sick dog will find out that another family has a sick dog and will not shoot his dog on the first day. When he finds out that the owner of the other sick dog did not kill his own dog on the first day, he will assume that the other side also saw a sick dog, and they will kill their own dog on the second day. There were no gunshots the next day, suggesting that there were more than two sick dogs in the village. If there are three sick dogs in the village, the owner of the sick dog will find out that other people have two sick dogs and will not shoot his dog for the first two days. If the owner of the other two dogs had not shot his own dogs in the previous two days, he would infer that the other dog had also seen the two sick dogs, and the three would shoot their own dogs on the third day. By analogy, if there are Ⅲ sick dogs in the village, the owner of the sick dog will see ⅲ-1 sick dog, when it found that no one killed his dog before ⅲ-1 days, then it can be inferred that his dog is a sick dog, thus killing his dog on the second day.

    "explanation": "The explanation is that unless many of them marry foreign women, most of them will remain unmarried. The explanation is that unmarried men over 30 outnumber unmarried women in this age group by a ratio of about 10 to 1. The premise of the argument is that men in this age group will only marry women in the same age group. Item C, “Most unmarried men in this country are unlikely to marry women older than they are,“ complements this point.
